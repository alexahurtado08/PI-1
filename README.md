# SafeDesk: Intelligent Security System for University Computers

## Project Overview

SafeDesk is an advanced security system designed to protect university computers using a combination of IoT hardware, facial recognition, and real-time alerts. Unlike traditional security cameras, SafeDesk prevents theft by detecting unauthorized movements and immediately notifying security personnel with relevant details, including the photo of the person who removed the equipment.

## Key Features

- **Real-time Monitoring** – Detects unauthorized movements of computers near classroom exits.
- **Instant Alerts** – Sends notifications within 5 seconds to security personnel.
- **Facial Recognition AI** – Identifies unauthorized users using a database of authorized personnel.
- **Geolocation Tracking** – Provides real-time location of computers if removed.
- **Wireless Connectivity** – Ensures remote access and communication.
- **Web-based Management** – Allows admin control over users, devices, and security logs.
- **History Log** – Stores alerts with date, time, location, and user details.

## System Requirements

### Hardware
- IoT sensors for proximity detection
- Camera for facial recognition
- Wireless communication module (Wi-Fi/Bluetooth)
- Alarm system for audible alerts

### Software
- Web application for system management
- AI-powered facial recognition API
- Database for storing authorized personnel and equipment data
- Integration with messaging services (e.g., Telegram) for alerts

## Installation and Setup

### 1. Hardware Deployment:
- Install IoT sensors and cameras near classroom exits.
- Connect devices to the SafeDesk network.
- Ensure cameras have a clear field of view for facial recognition.

### 2. Software Installation:
- Deploy the web application on a university server.
- Configure the database for users and computers.
- Set up the alert system with real-time notifications.

### 3. Configuration:
- Register authorized personnel in the system.
- Define security policies, including allowed removal times.
- Test facial recognition and notification delivery.

## Usage

1. **Detection:** If a computer is moved near a door, the system triggers an alert.
2. **Validation:** SafeDesk performs facial recognition within 3 minutes.
3. **Alert Transmission:** If unauthorized, the system sends a photo and alert to security staff.
4. **Tracking:** Security personnel can view real-time location and user details.
5. **Logging:** All events are stored for future review and analysis.
